TheCannonGalah
==============

This is the code associated with *The Cannon*, a data-driven method for
determining stellar labels (physical parameters and chemical abundances) from
stellar spectra in the context of large spectroscopic surveys. It closely
follows the method outlined in Ness et al. 2015, although some minor changes
have been made. A description of these changes will be outlined in Buder et al.\
 (in prep).
